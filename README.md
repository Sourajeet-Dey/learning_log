# Learning Log

### Made using Django Framework

Make your own Learning Log, and keep a list of the topics you're learning about. Whenever you learn something new about a topic, make an entry summarizing what you've learned.
Learning Log is an online journal system that lets the user keep track of information they have learned about particular topics.
There is a login system, which authenticates the user using their username and password. It helps in making the website secure. After logging in, the user can create a topic that they are learning and then make several entries under that topic. All the entries will be shown in a date-time decreasing order, so that the most recent entry shows at the top.
In case of an user trying to access an entry not owned by them, appropriate error page shows up.

### Challenges: 
By making this project, I have worked for the first time in Django. I have taken reference from the book - "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes to learn concepts of python and implementing it in a beautiful and helpful real world project.
As a beginner, getting a grasp over all the things in Django difficult for me. But I didn't stop there and followed along.
In user authentication system of Django, I had to go through the official documentation of Django to learn various concepts and implement them.
To make the website attractive, I have used some CSS, which I learnt for this purpose. In this work, one of my friends helped me very much.
